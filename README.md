# freebitcoin-bot
As a Raspberry Pi 3 B project, I tried to create some form of bot.


This is a bot that will do the rolls for you.
It will also use the reward points and will try to buy boosts.

Prerequesites:
- Linux Server with xfce4 or similar xserver running

this cannot run on Windows. Only the tampermonkey script may work, but who builds windows bots?!

How to use:
1. install chromium-browser
2. create an account on https://freebitco.in/?r=481926 (use this link to support me, won't hurt you)
3. install tampermonkey addon in browser
4. add the script code from browser_script.js to your script
5. open start.sh
